## Credits

I am using the following OSS projects to create my HTML slideshow:
* Reveal.js
* Bootstrap 3.0 (CSS)

My Erlang sample code attempts not to use any additional libraries for this
talk except for the free version of QuickCheck Mini which can be downloaded
[here](http://www.quviq.com/downloads/eqcmini.zip). However, I will add a
rebar.config file later to set it up with this repository as a dependency:
